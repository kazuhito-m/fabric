Thus, if a bug were found in 1.1 that affected 0.9 and could be easily applied, a new 0.9.x version *might* be released."

msgid "We hope that this policy will allow us to have a rapid minor release cycle (and thus keep new features coming out frequently) without causing users to feel too much pressure to upgrade right away. At the same time, the backwards compatibility guarantee means that users should still feel comfortable upgrading to the next minor release in order to stay within this sliding support window."
