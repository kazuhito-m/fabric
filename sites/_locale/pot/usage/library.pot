msgid "Fabric's primary use case is via fabfiles and the :doc:`fab </usage/fab>` tool, and this is reflected in much of the documentation. However, Fabric's internals are written in such a manner as to be easily used without ``fab`` or fabfiles at all -- this document will show you how."

msgid "There's really only a couple of considerations one must keep in mind, when compared to writing a fabfile and using ``fab`` to run it: how connections are really made, and how disconnections occur."

msgid "We've documented how Fabric really connects to its hosts before, but it's currently somewhat buried in the middle of the overall :doc:`execution docs </usage/execution>`. Specifically, you'll want to skip over to the :ref:`connections` section and read it real quick. (You should really give that entire document a once-over, but it's not absolutely required.)"

# 887ee6d1020b40b098461ddf9383b248
msgid "As that section mentions, the key is simply that `~fabric.operations.run`, `~fabric.operations.sudo` and the other operations only look in one place when connecting: :ref:`env.host_string <host_string>`. All of the other mechanisms for setting hosts are interpreted by the ``fab`` tool when it runs, and don't matter when running as a library."

msgid "That said, most use cases where you want to marry a given task ``X`` and a given list of hosts ``Y`` can, as of Fabric 1.3, be handled with the `~fabric.tasks.execute` function via ``execute(X, hosts=Y)``. Please see `~fabric.tasks.execute`'s documentation for details -- manual host string manipulation should be rarely necessary."

# be6d594676934a1f9a4eb212912ca36b
msgid "The other main thing that ``fab`` does for you is to disconnect from all hosts at the end of a session; otherwise, Python will sit around forever waiting for those network resources to be released."

msgid "Fabric 0.9.4 and newer have a function you can use to do this easily: `~fabric.network.disconnect_all`. Simply make sure your code calls this when it terminates (typically in the ``finally`` clause of an outer ``try: finally`` statement -- lest errors in your code prevent disconnections from happening!) and things ought to work pretty well."

msgid "If you're on Fabric 0.9.3 or older, you can simply do this (``disconnect_all`` just adds a bit of nice output to this logic)::"

msgid "This document is an early draft, and may not cover absolutely every difference between ``fab`` use and library use. However, the above should highlight the largest stumbling blocks. When in doubt, note that in the Fabric source code, ``fabric/main.py`` contains the bulk of the extra work done by ``fab``, and may serve as a useful reference."
