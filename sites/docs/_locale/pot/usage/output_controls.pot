msgid "The ``fab`` tool is very verbose by default and prints out almost everything it can, including the remote end's stderr and stdout streams, the command strings being executed, and so forth. While this is necessary in many cases in order to know just what's going on, any nontrivial Fabric task will quickly become difficult to follow as it runs."

msgid "To aid in organizing task output, Fabric output is grouped into a number of non-overlapping levels or groups, each of which may be turned on or off independently. This provides flexible control over what is displayed to the user."

msgid "**status**: Status messages, i.e. noting when Fabric is done running, if the user used a keyboard interrupt, or when servers are disconnected from. These messages are almost always relevant and rarely verbose."
msgstr ""

# b07107e11e834a12b9511d44b5994500
msgid "**aborts**: Abort messages. Like status messages, these should really only be turned off when using Fabric as a library, and possibly not even then. Note that even if this output group is turned off, aborts will still occur -- there just won't be any output about why Fabric aborted!"
msgstr ""

#: ../../usage/output_controls.rst:38
# a1f362c443f9432ab10b2b5a719c326b
msgid "**warnings**: Warning messages. These are often turned off when one expects a given operation to fail, such as when using ``grep`` to test existence of text in a file. If paired with setting ``env.warn_only`` to True, this can result in fully silent warnings when remote programs fail. As with ``aborts``, this setting does not control actual warning behavior, only whether warning messages are printed or hidden."
