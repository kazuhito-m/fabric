msgid "Fabric's primary use case is via fabfiles and the :doc:`fab </usage/fab>` tool, and this is reflected in much of the documentation. However, Fabric's internals are written in such a manner as to be easily used without ``fab`` or fabfiles at all -- this document will show you how."

msgid "There's really only a couple of considerations one must keep in mind, when compared to writing a fabfile and using ``fab`` to run it: how connections are really made, and how disconnections occur."

msgid "We've documented how Fabric really connects to its hosts before, but it's currently somewhat buried in the middle of the overall :doc:`execution docs </usage/execution>`. Specifically, you'll want to skip over to the :ref:`connections` section and read it real quick. (You should really give that entire document a once-over, but it's not absolutely required.)"

# 1a783ef3e2df4c109a6d7fe092c868c4
msgid "As that section mentions, the key is simply that `~fabric.operations.run`, `~fabric.operations.sudo` and the other operations only look in one place when connecting: :ref:`env.host_string <host_string>`. All of the other mechanisms for setting hosts are interpreted by the ``fab`` tool when it runs, and don't matter when running as a library."

# 73bb70a7c870474d861888bbac7e5710
msgid "That said, most use cases where you want to marry a given task ``X`` and a given list of hosts ``Y`` can, as of Fabric 1.3, be handled with the `~fabric.tasks.execute` function via ``execute(X, hosts=Y)``. Please see `~fabric.tasks.execute`'s documentation for details -- manual host string manipulation should be rarely necessary."

# 5a4f08818995423ea2a1faf417432212
msgid "The other main thing that ``fab`` does for you is to disconnect from all hosts at the end of a session; otherwise, Python will sit around forever waiting for those network resources to be released."

# 6173bae4ba9f40d78745e34940726551
msgid "Fabric 0.9.4 and newer have a function you can use to do this easily: `~fabric.network.disconnect_all`. Simply make sure your code calls this when it terminates (typically in the ``finally`` clause of an outer ``try: finally`` statement -- lest errors in your code prevent disconnections from happening!) and things ought to work pretty well."

msgid "If you're on Fabric 0.9.3 or older, you can simply do this (``disconnect_all`` just adds a bit of nice output to this logic)::"

msgid "This document is an early draft, and may not cover absolutely every difference between ``fab`` use and library use. However, the above should highlight the largest stumbling blocks. When in doubt, note that in the Fabric source code, ``fabric/main.py`` contains the bulk of the extra work done by ``fab``, and may serve as a useful reference."
